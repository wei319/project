# Project and script description
We have done RNA-seq screening and selected one hundred genes for further experimental validation. We have bought the cDNA clones for those genes from Origene company. We are going to subclone the genes into our viral expression vector. The purpose for this Python project is to download the cDNA clone sequences from the company's website and clone (paste) the gene into the viral expression vector automatically instead of manually doing the copy and paste tasks.

## Install packages or libraries used in this script

```shell
pip install pandas 
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Script description

The python script `generate_vector_to_html.py` will generate a html file to display the vector sequences of each gene for both cDNA and viral expression vectors.
