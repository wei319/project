# Project and script description
We have done RNA-seq screening and selected one hundred genes for further experimental validation. We have bought the cDNA clones for those genes from Origene company. We are going to subclone the genes into our viral expression vector. The purpose for this Python project is to download the cDNA clone sequences from the company's website and clone (paste) the gene into the viral expression vector automatically instead of manually doing the copy and paste tasks.



Python project for gene sequence download from the company's websiteand export
